  <div id="scrolling-story">
    <p id="essay">
      Guided content, scrolling story Content and information is interspersed as pauses between scrolling tours through the 3d scan. User has control to move forward and backward in narrative, and to pause at a location, but not to move freely about the model
    </p>
    <p>
      User will scroll and screen view will take user through Flushing Meadows Park There will be an essay which should be viewed with a black background (scrolled through) separate from the 3d scan The screen shots here are only meant to demonstrate places the guided tour might move to and around — there will not be separately framed views of the model — the viewer will be moved through the 3d model by the tour (and by scrolling) QM is to create an outline to show where they want the tour to go and what it should show.
