      <p>A World's Fair—also known as an <span class="text-italics"> expo,</span> an <span class="text-italics">exposition, </span>or a <span class="text-italics">universal exhibition</span>—is a gathering of nations with the intention of sharing technology, culture, and information. An assortment of countries and municipalities, corporations, and religious sects build pavilions to host exhibitions, demonstrations, and performances for paying visitors. The first World's Fair held in New York City, the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, took place in 1853 at the Crystal Palace in what is now Bryant Park.</p>

      <h2>Why was there a World's Fair in 1964?</h2>
      <p>The 1950s and early 1960s saw several financial crises that lasted less than a year each. The consistent creation of highways led families out of cities and into suburbia. In an attempt to kick-start economic growth in New York City, a crew of politicians, municipal employees, financiers, and diplomats joined city developer Robert Moses in conceiving of the 1964&mdash;1965 New York World's Fair. </p>

        <p>In April 1939, the New York World's Fair opened in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, themed “Building the World of Tomorrow.” The park had been converted from a dumping ground for ashes to a manicured park, encompassing 897 acres of green grass and paved avenues. The Fair was open for two seasons (April 30&mdash;October 31, 1939; May 11&mdash;October 27, 1940), and approximately 45 million people visited during that time. It cost $0.75 (approximately $16 in 2022) to enter the Fair. </p>

      <p>At the 1939&mdash;1940 World's Fair, models and dioramas were a vivid method for depicting visions of future cities. One of the two iconic symbols of the Fair, the Perisphere, held an exhibition called <span class="text-italics">Democracity,</span> a model city of the future that visitors saw from above as they walked along a path around the perimeter of the object. General Motors' Pavilion exhibition, <span class="text-italics">Futurama</span>, was an audio-visual experience that brought visitors to what the corporation thought cities might look like in 1960. Seated guests moved through several spaces within the 35,000 square-feet pavilion. As they moved around the model of this imagined city, shifts in scale and a voice-over broadcast through speakers embedded into each chair described the characteristics of the model in front of and below them. Consolidated Edison's <span class="text-italics">City of Lights</span> exhibition was a larger-than-life recreation of Midtown Manhattan, composed of a foreground of three-dimensional buildings that tapered off into a painting that looked across the Hudson River into New Jersey. This installation occupied the equivalent of one New York City block!</p>

      <p>The 1964&mdash;1965 New York World's Fair was constructed by the World's Fair Corporation, presided over by Robert Moses. It was not technically deemed an official “World's Expo” by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), which meant the Corporation had to recruit participants for each pavilion and members of the BIE—including the Netherlands, Greece, France, Portugal, Italy, and the United Kingdom, among others—could not technically participate. This facilitated an obvious corporate presence and attracted younger nations seeking visibility on the global stage. Flushing Meadows Corona Park began to transform starting in 1962 when ground was broken by President John F. Kennedy. </p>

      <p>Similar to the 1939&mdash;1940 New York World's Fair, there were two distinct seasons for the event (April 22&mdash;October 18, 1964; April 21&mdash;October 17, 1965). Although 75 million people were expected to attend, just over 51 million visitors maneuvered the fairgrounds over the two years. The Unisphere, created by the United States Steel Corporation for the Fair, was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, created for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. It was the symbol of the Fair, used extensively for advertising and souvenirs, and remains the largest globe on the planet standing at 140-feet tall. </p>

      <p>The Fair celebrated the 300th anniversary of the founding of New York City, commemorating the moment in 1664 when the Dutch surrendered what was once “New Amsterdam'' to the British. The theme for the Fair was “Peace Through Understanding.” Together, these two topics inspired an event driven by information, technology, and attention to culture from around the world. Major pavilions sponsored by General Motors, Bell Telephone System, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Equitable Life Insurance, and International Business Machines (IBM) shared innovations including the color television, “the Picturephone,” and new methods of computerized translation. </p>
