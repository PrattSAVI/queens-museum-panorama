        <h2>Why is The Panorama at the Queens Museum?</h2>
        <p>The New York City Building, now the Queens Museum, was an important landmark in the 1964–1965 New York World’s Fair, sitting at the heart of the fairgrounds just behind the Unisphere. The main attraction was The Panorama of the City of New York. .</p>

Both titles are in all-caps. Eight flags are posted and flying above the roof of the building. There are a handful of visitors in the foreground.">

        </div>
        <p>The Panorama was conceived of by Robert Moses and long-time model maker, Raymond Lester. Lester was familiar with building larger-than-life three-dimensional environments: he worked with designer Norman Bel Geddes as an artist and fabricator. Bel Geddes was the mastermind behind the original Futurama exhibition at the 1939–1940 New York World’s Fair, also held in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Later on, Lester produced models of civic projects for Moses and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA). His company, Lester Associates, Inc., was formed in 1950 and remained in business until the 1980s. </p>

        <p>The entire model, which depicted all five boroughs of New York City, cost $672,662.69 to create in 1964, the equivalent of approximately $6.7 million in 2022. The New York City Building hosted The Panorama in a space that had been dedicated to roller skating in the early 1940s, and throughout the 1950s. The model continues to occupy approximately half of the publicly-accessible space in the building. </p>

        <p>Before construction could begin on the model itself, Lester Associates undertook approximately 20,000 hours of research. “Land Books” by G.W. Bromley & Co., Inc.; Sanborn fire insurance maps; photographs collected from local agencies such as the Port Authority; zoning index maps from the City Planning Commission; the City of New York Official Directory, 
          and contour maps were consulted to understand the types of residential, commercial, and municipal properties on each street. Two flights above New York City produced vertical photographs that were vital for spatial renderings, as were thousands of oblique photographs of landmark buildings across the five boroughs, sourced from public libraries, city agencies and departments, and the City’s municipal archives.

      <p>With these resources, Lester Associates strove to represent New York City with a 1% margin of error. At the workshop in Thornwood, New York, over 100 people contributed approximately 40,000 work-hours to create the original model. There were 186 panels in a standard size (4 feet x 10 feet x ¾ inch) and 86 irregularly-shaped panels (¾ inch thick) to account for the curvatures of the room. The panels were supported by 497 steel legs standing 34-inches tall, beneath steel plates that supported the model. All the original panels were constructed from Formica flakeboard and encased in douglas fir frames. The surfaces were covered in Urethane foam, then contoured and sanded by hand.</p>

      <p>Panels with finished, sculpted surfaces were coated with an epoxy resin then painted to reflect specific purposes. Roadways were categorized as highways and parkways (light tan), urban blocks (green), city blocks (off-white), and local roads (dark gray). Miniature cars, technically the size of a grain of rice at this scale, were placed on roadways among buses and trucks. As a testament to Robert Moses’ massive impact on New York City, many of his most beloved and notorious initiatives are highlighted on The Panorama. Parks are indicated with bright green paint that glows in the dark. Cemeteries are light green. Pale pink areas indicate recreational facilities including pools, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, and tennis courts open to the public. Red buildings portray public housing projects created by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), starting shortly after the Great Depression in 1935. </p>
