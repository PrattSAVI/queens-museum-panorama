        <h2>Why is <span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> at the Queens Museum?</h2>
        <p>The New York City Building, now the Queens Museum, was an important landmark in the 1964–1965 New York World’s Fair, sitting at the heart of the fairgrounds just behind the Unisphere. The main attraction was <span class="text-italics">The Panorama of the City of New York.</span></p>

        <p><span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> was conceived of by Robert Moses and long-time model maker, Raymond Lester. Lester was familiar with building larger-than-life three-dimensional environments: he worked with designer Norman Bel Geddes as an artist and fabricator. Bel Geddes was the mastermind behind the original <span class="text-italics">Futurama </span>exhibition at the 1939–1940 New York World’s Fair, also held in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Later on, Lester produced models of civic projects for Moses and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA). His company, Lester Associates, Inc., was formed in 1950 and remained in business until the 1980s. </p>

        <p>The entire model, which depicted all five boroughs of New York City, cost $672,662.69 to create in 1964, the equivalent of approximately $6.7 million in 2022. The New York City Building hosted <span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> in a space that had been dedicated to roller skating in the early 1940s, and throughout the 1950s. The model continues to occupy approximately half of the publicly-accessible space in the building. </p>

        <p>Before construction could begin on the model itself, Lester Associates undertook approximately 20,000 hours of research. “Land Books” by G.W. Bromley & Co., Inc.; Sanborn fire insurance maps; photographs collected from local agencies such as the Port Authority; zoning index maps from the City Planning Commission; the City of New York Official Directory, 
        and contour maps were consulted to understand the types of residential, commercial, and municipal properties on each street. Two flights above New York City produced vertical photographs that were vital for spatial renderings, as were thousands of oblique photographs of landmark buildings across the five boroughs, sourced from public libraries, city agencies and departments, and the City’s municipal archives.

      <p>With these resources, Lester Associates strove to represent New York City with a 1% margin of error. At the workshop in Thornwood, New York, over 100 people contributed approximately 40,000 work-hours to create the original model. There were 186 panels in a standard size (4 feet x 10 feet x ¾ inch) and 86 irregularly-shaped panels (¾ inch thick) to account for the curvatures of the room. The panels were supported by 497 steel legs standing 34-inches tall, beneath steel plates that supported the model. All the original panels were constructed from Formica flakeboard and encased in douglas fir frames. The surfaces were covered in Urethane foam, then contoured and sanded by hand.</p>

      <p>Panels with finished, sculpted surfaces were coated with an epoxy resin then painted to reflect specific purposes. Roadways were categorized as highways and parkways (light tan), urban blocks (green), city blocks (off-white), and local roads (dark gray). Miniature cars, technically the size of a grain of rice at this scale, were placed on roadways among buses and trucks. As a testament to Robert Moses’ massive impact on New York City, many of his most beloved and notorious initiatives are highlighted on <span class="text-italics">The Panorama.</span> Parks are indicated with bright green paint that glows in the dark. Cemeteries are light green. Pale pink areas indicate recreational facilities including pools, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, and tennis courts open to the public. Red buildings portray public housing projects created by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), starting shortly after the Great Depression in 1935. </p>

    <p><span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> originally included approximately 850,000 structures, each fastened to the model with epoxy adhesive. In 1964, the majority of those structures were one- and two-story buildings. All the buildings of this size were made of acrylic plastic in 150 different shapes, produced by injection molds with minimal detail but a variety of colors. Medium to large buildings were made of poplar wood blocks. Brownstones and tenements, among the 115,000 buildings between four and six stories tall, were produced from forty styles. Larger buildings had some detail including painted windows, and were sourced from 24 styles. “Special” buildings in need of extreme customization—nearly 100,000 skyscrapers, landmarks, major churches, factories, colleges, and hospitals—were made of plastic. </p>

    <p>The awe-inspiring scale of <span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> was enhanced by its details. Sixty bridges, fabricated in brass by way of a chemical etching process for ultimate accuracy, span waterways throughout the boroughs. Long Island and New Jersey were beyond the city limits, but their coastlines appear in black along the perimeter of the room. Two planes fly in and out of LaGuardia Airport on an invisible thread. The model is also animated by a “day-to-night” light cycle every twelve minutes. At night, the city’s parks and Manhattan’s skyscraper windows are illuminated by ultraviolet light, and a sea of colored lights appear across the city. These 3,172 lights highlighted the city’s municipal buildings: police precincts, firehouses, schools, hospitals, courthouses, libraries, public housing projects, as well as water, gas and electric stations. The colors—red, yellow, green, blue, white—each indicated a different type of structure within five major categories: “Recreation,” “Commerce/Welfare/Transportation,”  “Health,” “Education,” and “Protection.”

    <p>Upon stepping into one of the 54 helicopter cars, the visitor was thrust into New York City. Famous radio newscaster Lowell Thomas recited “The City of Opportunity,” a monologue speaking to the vast resources available, as the colored lights on the map illuminated to reflect statistics related to social welfare, population growth, and activities for all. The helicopter moved around the perimeter. Recreating a height of approximately 3,000 feet, each helicopter ride went from Staten Island to Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. The ride lasted approximately ten minutes.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the helicopter ride, the visitor to The Panorama was sent to the second floor viewing gallery. There, they could see treasures from the city’s museums, and exhibitions sponsored by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. <span class="text-italics">The Panorama </span>was surrounded by a wall of glass windows, allowing viewers to contemplate the city from a bird’s-eye view for as long as they desired.</p>
