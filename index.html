      <p><span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> was completed for the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair, which took place in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. It is built at a 1:1200 scale, which means a human on the model is as large as a grain of sand, and the Empire State Building is 12 ½ inches tall. The entire model is 9,335 square-feet, comprising 273 pieces.</p>

      <h2>What's the Purpose of The Panorama?</h2>

      <!--  image number 3 -->
      <p>
        This model was commissioned by Robert Moses, the infamous political dynamo and builder of New York City's infrastructure in the first half of the twentieth century. He was Commissioner of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) from its inception and the first Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks. Over thirty years, he influenced the construction of two tunnels and thirteen bridges, and the creation of public parks, recreation centers, pools, roads, and parkways. <span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> was meant to be a city planning tool and informational asset used by city planners and government officials. It could be separated into pieces for research, and updated as new buildings, roads, and large-scale projects were designed. It also had an educational function, and remained on-display after the World's Fair closed in 1965.

      <h2>When was it updated last?</h2>

      <!--  image number 5 -->
      <p><span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> was last updated in the early 1990s by the original model makers from Lester Associates, Inc. What you see at the Queens Museum depicts January 1, 1992. When span class="text-italics">The Panorama</span> debuted in 1964 at the World's Fair, there were 854,635 buildings on the map; when the model premiered in 1994 with a complete update, this number increased to 895,000. Except for a few singular and iconic updates—including Citifield, the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, and Yankee Stadium—, the model has not been updated since.</p>
